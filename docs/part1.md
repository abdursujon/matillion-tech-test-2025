# Part 1: Fix the Failing Tests ⚠️

The test class "Part1Tests" contains a test suite with multiple failing tests. Your first task is to:
- Run the test suite and identify all failing tests
- Analyze what functionality is missing or broken
- Implement the necessary code to make all tests pass
- Ensure that your fixes are robust and follow best practices

## Getting Started

Run the Part 1 tests:
```bash
./gradlew test --tests Part1Tests
```

## What to Focus On

- Carefully read each test to understand what functionality is expected
- Look at the test assertions to see what outputs are required
- Examine the existing codebase to understand the architecture
- Implement the missing functionality to make all tests pass

## Tips

- Don't skip over any failing tests - they all need to pass
- Consider edge cases and error handling
- Follow the patterns established in the existing code
- Write clean, maintainable code that others can understand
