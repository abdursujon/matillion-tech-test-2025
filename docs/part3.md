# Part 3: Design and Implement a New Feature ðŸ’¡

Think creatively and propose a new piece of functionality that would enhance this service - it's totally up to you!

## Your Task

This is your opportunity to showcase:
- Your creativity and product thinking
- Your ability to identify valuable features
- Your implementation skills
- Your understanding of good API design

## Guidelines

### What to Consider

- **User Value**: What would make this service more useful?
- **Technical Fit**: How does it complement the existing functionality?
- **Scope**: Keep it realistic and achievable
- **Quality**: Better to implement one feature well than many features poorly

### Possible Ideas (feel free to use or ignore these!)

- Data validation and quality checks
- Export functionality (JSON, Excel, etc.)
- Statistical analysis (mean, median, standard deviation)
- Data filtering or transformation capabilities
- Batch processing of multiple CSVs
- Historical tracking and comparison
- Data visualization endpoints
- Column correlation analysis
- Missing data handling strategies

## What to Deliver

1. **Documentation**: Explain your feature in a brief markdown file
   - What problem does it solve?
   - How does it work?
   - How would someone use it?

2. **Implementation**: Write the code to implement your feature
   - Follow the existing code patterns
   - Include proper error handling
   - Make it production-quality

3. **Tests**: Write tests to verify your feature works
   - Cover the main use cases
   - Test edge cases and error scenarios
   - Follow the existing test patterns

## Tips

- Start simple - a well-implemented simple feature beats a half-finished complex one
- Consider both the API design and the implementation
- Don't be afraid to be creative and try something unique!
- Document your thought process and design decisions

## Questions to Ask Yourself

- Is the API intuitive and easy to use?
- Have I handled errors gracefully?
- Would this be maintainable by other developers?
- Have I tested it thoroughly?

Good luck, and have fun with it! This is your chance to shine and show us how you think about building software.
